Update 10-31-19: Currently the original chain is ¡®stuck¡¯! Satoshi¡¯s original difficulty adjustment algorithm was used, which only works out if the network gets a slow start. FPGA-tier power is now necessary to move this blockchain.



For this reason, the community created a hardfork at block 20418, BSHA3-LWMA.
